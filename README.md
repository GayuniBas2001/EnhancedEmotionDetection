# EnhancedEmotionDetection
A hybrid emotion recognition system that combines YOLO's object detection capabilities with fuzzy logic to enhance the accuracy and reliability of facial emotion detection. This project aims to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more by analyzing facial features and applying rule-based fuzzy logic for nuanced recognition.
